- CADAVER -

Cadaver only has one rotten eye, so he can only fire at a fixed 1.5 tears per second. All tear pickups are converted to an equivalent damage multiplier.

Cadaver can only obtain Rotten Hearts and Bone Hearts. Any red hearts that spawn are converted to Rotten Hearts, with a rare chance to convert into a Bone Heart.

Cadaver can pickup soul hearts, but they are immediately removed to spawn friendly critters!

Birthright turns all current and future blue flies into locusts!

Cadaver starts with Yuck Heart. Use it in combat or in Curse Rooms to hold on to your bone hearts.</description>
