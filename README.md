# Cadaver: The Rotten Expansion
Cadaver is a mod for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance that adds 7 new unlocks and 1 new playable character! Explore the basement with Cadaver, Isaac's rotting corpse, and gain access to Golden Souls, Rotten Chests, and more!

## The Character
***Base Stats***  
Damage: 6.36  
Fire Rate: 1.5  
Max Health: 0 (+ 1 Bone Heart filled with a Rotten Heart)  
*All other stats are the same as Isaac.*  

***Passives***
* Cadaver only has one rotten eye, so he can only fire at a **fixed 1.5 tears per second**. Those tears are nasty though! All **tear pickups are converted to an equivalent damage multiplier.** Cadaver keeps the same DPS as normal Isaac, but with all of the stats weighted towards Damage.
* Cadaver can **only obtain Rotten Hearts and Bone Hearts.** 
* Items that heal Isaac or give maximum HP will instead give Rotten Hearts.
* Any **red hearts that spawn are converted** to Rotten Hearts, with a rare chance to convert into a Bone Heart.
* Cadaver **can pickup soul hearts, but they are immediately removed to spawn friendly critters**! You made friends in the grave, after all.

***Birthright***  
*Better friends*  
When Cadaver has Birthright, all current and future **blue flies are converted into random Locusts.** 

## Unlocks
***Vestments [Angel Room]***  
*Defeat Isaac and ??? as Cadaver*  
Gain a random Angel Room item effect in every room. This item counts towards the Seraphim transformation. Leaving and re-entering a room will give the same effect each time.

***Probiotics [Trinket]***  
*Defeat Satan and The Lamb as Cadaver*  
If Isaac has a Rotten Heart, gain a moderate stat boost:
+1 flat damage
-0.5 Tear Delay
+0.25 Speed
+1 Luck

***Soul of Cadaver***  
*Defeat Hush as Cadaver*  
Spawns 8 small friendly leeches, 8 small friendly maggots, 1 bone heart, and 2 rotten hearts.

***Cadaver's Left Eye***  
*Defeat Delirium as Cadaver*  
+2 flat damage  
Fixes fire rate at 1.5 and converts all tear ups into an equivalent damage multiplier.

***Forbidden Fruit [Devil Room]***  
*Defeat Mother as Cadaver*  
One time use active. When used, gain a permanent 3x damage multiplier and 0.5x tear delay multiplier. Once used, Isaac takes 1 instance of damage every 4 seconds until the end of the run (persists through resurrections).

***Golden Soul***  
*Defeat The Beast as Cadaver*  
Activates a random soul effect. Has a 60% chance to remain in Isaac's pocket after use.

***Rotten Chests***  
*Defeat Mega Satan as Cadaver*  
Rotten Chests replace 10% of normal chest spawns. They do not require a key.  
When opened, has a 15% chance to spawn a "rotten" pedestal item. Otherwise, spawns 2 normal pickups and 1 "rotten" pickup.  

Normal pickups: coin, heart, key, bomb.  
Rotten pickups: 2 rotten hearts, 1 bone heart, 1 "rotten" trinket  

## Known Issues
* There are many missing Cadaver costumes. Picking up some items may make Cadaver look like Isaac. This is a Work in Progress.
* Several effects ignore item unlocks. For instance, you can obtain bone hearts before unlocking them. I am not aware of a way to avoid this.
* Achievements show up immediately upon a boss dying, rather than after the run has completed / in between stages. I am not aware of a way to avoid this.
